## Overview

A minimalistic and lightweight chess game, made from C++ using SDL2, NanoSVG and Stockfish chess engine.
## How to run
This game is developed for Windows user. 
Assume that makefile is installed, run `make all` at `CS160_Chess` directory to trigger makefile to build the executable. After that, the executable of the gmae can be found at `CS160_Chess/`

An alternative way to build the game is to run `BuildScriptWindows.ps1` at `CS160_Chess`. It will automatically compile the source and produce an executable file at `CS160_Chess/`.
